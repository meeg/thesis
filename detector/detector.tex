\chapter{The HPS Detector}

The HPS detector is a spectrometer with a silicon vertex tracker for momentum measurement and a electromagnetic calorimeter for energy measurement and trigger.
The detector is installed in the middle dipole of a three-magnet chicane, with the field extending from the target foil to the end of the tracker.
