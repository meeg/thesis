	abstract = {Experimenters report an upper limit if the signal they are trying to detect is nonexistent or below their experiment’s sensitivity. Such experiments may be contaminated with a background too poorly understood to subtract. If the background is distributed differently in some parameter from the expected signal, it is possible to take advantage of this difference to get a stronger limit than would be possible if the difference in distribution were ignored. We discuss the “maximum gap” method, which finds the best gap between events for setting an upper limit, and generalize to the “optimum interval” method, which uses intervals with especially few events. These methods, which apply to the case of relatively small backgrounds, do not use binning, are relatively insensitive to cuts on the range of the parameter, are parameter independent (i.e., do not change when a one-one change of variables is made), and provide true, though possibly conservative, classical one-sided confidence intervals.},

	abstract = {The SLAC RCE platform is a general purpose clustered data acquisition system implemented on a custom ATCA compliant blade, called the Cluster On Board (COB). The core of the system is the Reconfigurable Cluster Element (RCE), which is a system-on-chip design based upon the Xilinx Zynq family of FPGAs, mounted on custom COB daughter-boards. The Zynq architecture couples a dual core ARM Cortex A9 based processor with a high performance 28nm FPGA. The RCE has 12 external general purpose bi-directional high speed links, each supporting serial rates of up to 12Gbps. 8 RCE nodes are included on a COB, each with a 10Gbps connection to an on-board 24-port Ethernet switch integrated circuit. The COB is designed to be used with a standard full-mesh ATCA backplane allowing multiple RCE nodes to be tightly interconnected with minimal interconnect latency. Multiple shelves can be clustered using the front panel 10-gbps connections. The COB also supports local and inter-blade timing and trigger distribution. An experiment specific Rear Transition Module adapts the 96 high speed serial links to specific experiments and allows an experiment-specific timing and busy feedback connection. This coupling of processors with a high performance FPGA fabric in a low latency, multiple node cluster allows high speed data processing that can be easily adapted to any physics experiment. RTEMS and Linux are both ported to the module. The RCE has been used or is the baseline for several current and proposed experiments (LCLS, HPS, LSST, ATLAS-CSC, LBNE, DarkSide, ILC-SiD, etc)},

The chip is fabricated in a standard 0.25 μm CMOS process to take advantage of the radiation tolerance, lower noise and power, and high circuit density. Experimental characterisation of this circuit shows full functionality and good performance both in pre- and post-irradiation (20 Mrad) conditions.

	abstract = {The KEKB factory (Tsukuba, Japan) has been shut down in mid-2010 after reaching a total integrated luminosity of 1ab-1. Recently, the work on an upgrade of the collider (SuperKEKB), aiming at an ultimate luminosity of 8×1035 cm-2s-1, has started. This is 40 times the peak value of the previous system and thus also requires a redesign of the Belle detector (leading to Belle II), especially its Silicon Vertex Detector (SVD), which surrounds the beam pipe. Similar to its predecessor, the future Belle II SVD will again consist of four layers of double-sided silicon strip sensors (DSSD), but at higher radii. Moreover, a double-layer PiXel Detector (PXD) will complement the SVD as the innermost sensing device. All DSSDs will be made from 6” silicon wafers and read out by APV25 chips, which were originally developed for the CMS experiment. That system was proven to meet the requirements for Belle II in matters of occupancy and dead time. Since the KEKB factory operates at relatively low energy, material inside the active volume has to be minimized in order to reduce multiple scattering. This can be achieved by the Origami chip-on-sensor concept, including a very light-weight mechanical support structure made from carbon fiber reinforced Airex foam. Moreover, CO2 cooling for the front-end chips will ensure high efficiency at minimum material budget.},

	abstract = {We have developed a modular readout system for the 30,720 channel Forward GEM Tracker recently installed in the STAR Experiment at RHIC, BNL. The modular architecture is based on a passive compact PCI backplane running a custom protocol, not PCI, connecting 6 readout modules to a readout controller module. The readout modules provide all necessary functions, including isolated power supplies, to operate up to 24 APV25 chips per module with high-impedance ground isolation. The front-end boards contain a minimal set of components as they are located inside the STAR TPC inner field cage and are inaccessible except during long shutdown periods. The front-end boards connect to the readout modules with cables up to 24 m in length, carrying unbuffered analog readout signals from the APV25 as well as power, trigger, clock and control. The readout module digitizes the APV analog samples to 12 bits at 37.532 MHz, and zero suppresses and buffers the data. The readout controller distributes trigger and clock from the central trigger system, gathers the data over the backplane, and ships it to a linux PC via a 2.125 Gbps optical data link (Detector Data Link (DDL) from ALICE). The PC gathers data from multiple readout controllers and dispatches it to the STAR event builders. The readout modules, controllers, and backplanes are housed in a common crate together with the GEM HV bias power supplies.},

	abstract = {Electron scattering fixed target experiments are a versatile tool to explore various physics phenomena. Recently these experiments came into focus to search for \$U(1)\$ extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics at low energies. These extensions are motivated from anomalies in astrophysical observations as well as from deviations from Standard Model predictions, such as the discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical determination of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. They also arise naturally when the Standard Model is embedded into a more general theory. In the considered \$U(1)\$ extensions a new, light messenger particle \${\textbackslash}gamma{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}prime\$, the hidden photon, couples to the hidden sector as well as to the electromagnetic current of the Standard Model by kinetic mixing, which allows for a search for this particle e.g. in the invariant mass distribution of the process \$e (A,{\textbackslash},Z){\textbackslash}rightarrow e (A,{\textbackslash},Z) l{\textasciicircum}+ l{\textasciicircum}-\$. In this process the hidden photon is emitted by bremsstrahlung and decays into a pair of Standard Model leptons. In this work we study the applicability of the Weizs{\textbackslash}"acker-Williams approximation to calculate the signal cross section of the process, which is widely used to design such experimental setups. Furthermore, based on a previous work, we investigate the discovery potential of future experimental setups at the Jefferson Lab. For that purpose we simulate the relevant cross sections for the signal and the QED background in the actual kinematical setups and obtain projected exclusion limits.},

Nature may contain numerous dark sectors, each with their own beautiful structure, distinct particles, and forces. This review summarizes the physics motivation for dark sectors and the exciting opportunities for experimental exploration. It is the summary of the Intensity Frontier subgroup "New, Light, Weakly-coupled Particles" of the Community Summer Study 2013 (Snowmass). We discuss axions, which solve the strong CP problem and are an excellent dark matter candidate, and their generalization to axion-like particles. We also review dark photons and other dark-sector particles, including sub-GeV dark matter, which are theoretically natural, provide for dark matter candidates or new dark matter interactions, and could resolve outstanding puzzles in particle and astro-particle physics. In many cases, the exploration of dark sectors can proceed with existing facilities and comparatively modest experiments. A rich, diverse, and low-cost experimental program has been identified that has the potential for one or more game-changing discoveries. These physics opportunities should be vigorously pursued in the US and elsewhere.},

	abstract = {In a broad class of consistent models, MeV to few-GeV dark matter interacts with ordinary matter through weakly coupled GeV scale mediators. We show that a suitable meter scale (or smaller) detector situated downstream of an electron beam dump can sensitively probe dark matter interacting via sub-GeV mediators, while B-factory searches cover the 1–5 GeV range. Combined, such experiments explore a well-motivated and otherwise inaccessible region of dark matter parameter space with sensitivity several orders of magnitude beyond existing direct detection constraints. These experiments would also probe invisibly decaying new gauge bosons (“dark photons”) down to kinetic mixing of ϵ∼10−4, including the range of parameters relevant for explaining the (g−2)μ discrepancy. Sensitivity to other long-lived dark sector states and to new millicharge particles would also be improved.},

In this largely unexplored mass range, dark matter scattering with electrons can cause single-electron ionization signals, which are detectable with current technology. Ultraviolet photons, individual ions, and heat are interesting alternative signals. Focusing on ionization, we calculate the expected dark matter scattering rates and estimate the sensitivity of possible experiments. Backgrounds that may be relevant are discussed. Theoretically interesting models may be within reach using existing data and ongoing direct detection experiments. Significant improvements in sensitivity should be possible with dedicated experiments, opening up a window to new regions in dark matter parameter space.},

	abstract = {High-energy colliders offer a unique sensitivity to dark photons, the mediators of a broken dark U(1) gauge theory that kinetically mixes with the Standard Model (SM) hypercharge. Dark photons can be detected in the exotic decay of the 125 GeV Higgs boson, h -{\textgreater} Z Z\_D -{\textgreater} 4l, and in Drell-Yan events, pp -{\textgreater} Z\_D -{\textgreater} ll. If the dark U(1) is broken by a hidden-sector Higgs mechanism, then mixing between the dark and SM Higgs bosons also allows the exotic decay h -{\textgreater} Z\_D Z\_D -{\textgreater} 4l. We show that the 14 TeV LHC and a 100 TeV proton-proton collider provide powerful probes of both exotic Higgs decay channels. In the case of kinetic mixing alone, direct Drell-Yan production offers the best sensitivity to Z\_D, and can probe epsilon {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 9 x 10{\textasciicircum}(-4) (4 x 10{\textasciicircum}(-4)) at the HL-LHC (100 TeV pp collider). The exotic Higgs decay h -{\textgreater} Z Z\_D offers slightly weaker sensitivity, but both measurements are necessary to distinguish the kinetically mixed dark photon from other scenarios. If Higgs mixing is also present, then the decay h -{\textgreater} Z\_D Z\_D can allow sensitivity to the Z\_D for epsilon {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}(-9) - 10{\textasciicircum}(-6) (10{\textasciicircum}(-10) - 10{\textasciicircum}(-7)) for the mass range 2 m\_mu {\textless} m\_(Z\_D) {\textless} m\_h/2 by searching for displaced dark photon decays. We also compare the Z\_D sensitivity at pp colliders to the indirect, but model-independent, sensitivity of global fits to electroweak precision observables. We perform a global electroweak fit of the dark photon model, substantially updating previous work in the literature. Electroweak precision measurements at LEP, Tevatron, and the LHC exclude epsilon as low as 3 x 10{\textasciicircum}(-2). Sensitivity can be improved by up to a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 with HL-LHC data, and an additional factor of {\textasciitilde}4 with ILC/GigaZ data.},

	abstract = {A new theory of WIMP Dark Matter has been proposed, motivated directly by striking Data from the PAMELA and ATIC collaborations. The WIMP is taken to be charged under a hidden gauge symmetry G\_Dark, broken near the GeV scale; this also provides the necessary ingredients for the "exciting" and "inelastic" Dark Matter interpretations of the INTEGRAL and DAMA signals. In this short note we point out the consequences of the most straightforward embedding of this simple picture within low-energy SUSY, in which G\_Dark breaking at the GeV scale arises naturally through radiative corrections, or Planck-suppressed operators. The theory predicts major additions to SUSY signals at the LHC. A completely generic prediction is that G\_Dark particles can be produced in cascade decays of MSSM superpartners, since these end with pairs of MSSM LSP's that in turn decay into the true LSP and other particles in the dark sector. In turn, the lightest GeV-scale dark Higgses and gauge bosons eventually decay back into light SM states, and dominantly into leptons. Therefore, a large fraction of all SUSY events will contain at least two ``lepton jets'': collections of n{\textgreater}= 2 leptons, with small angular separations and GeV scale invariant masses. Furthermore, if the Dark Matter sector is directly charged under the Standard Model, the success of gauge coupling unification implies the presence of new long-lived colored particles that can be copiously produced at the LHC.},

	abstract = {We propose a comprehensive theory of dark matter that explains the recent proliferation of unexpected observations in high-energy astrophysics. Cosmic ray spectra from ATIC and PAMELA require a WIMP with mass M\_chi {\textasciitilde} 500 - 800 GeV that annihilates into leptons at a level well above that expected from a thermal relic. Signals from WMAP and EGRET reinforce this interpretation. Taken together, we argue these facts imply the presence of a GeV-scale new force in the dark sector. The long range allows a Sommerfeld enhancement to boost the annihilation cross section as required, without altering the weak scale annihilation cross section during dark matter freezeout in the early universe. If the dark matter annihilates into the new force carrier, phi, its low mass can force it to decay dominantly into leptons. If the force carrier is a non-Abelian gauge boson, the dark matter is part of a multiplet of states, and splittings between these states are naturally generated with size alpha m\_phi {\textasciitilde} MeV, leading to the eXciting dark matter (XDM) scenario previously proposed to explain the positron annihilation in the galactic center observed by the INTEGRAL satellite. Somewhat smaller splittings would also be expected, providing a natural source for the parameters of the inelastic dark matter (iDM) explanation for the DAMA annual modulation signal. Since the Sommerfeld enhancement is most significant at low velocities, early dark matter halos at redshift {\textasciitilde}10 potentially produce observable effects on the ionization history of the universe, and substructure is more detectable than with a conventional WIMP. Moreover, the low velocity dispersion of dwarf galaxies and Milky Way subhalos can greatly increase the substructure annihilation signal.},

For dark matter with a mass of {\textbackslash}sim10 GeV, the shape of the resulting gamma-ray spectrum provides a good fit to that observed from the Galactic Center, and can also provide the very hard electron spectrum required to account for the observed synchrotron emission from the Milky Way's radio filaments. For kinetic mixing near the level naively expected from loop-suppressed operators (epsilon {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}), the dark matter is predicted to scatter elastically with protons with a cross section consistent with that required to accommodate the signals reported by DAMA/LIBRA, CoGeNT and CRESST-II.},

Some of these observations may be the first signs of a low-mass dark sector that collider searches can definitively confirm. Production and decay of ⬚⬚(GeV)-mass dark states is mediated by a Higgsed Abelian gauge boson that mixes kinetically with hypercharge. Existing data from BABAR, BELLE, CLEO-c, and KLOE may contain thousands of striking dark-sector events with a high multiplicity of leptons that reconstruct mass resonances and possibly displaced vertices.

In models whose supersymmetry (SUSY)-breaking hidden sectors contain U(1) gauge factors, we show that such terms will generically arise and communicate SUSY-breaking to the visible sector through mixing with hypercharge. In the context of the usual supergravity- or gauge-mediated communication scenarios with D-terms of order the fundamental scale of SUSY-breaking, this effect can destabilize the gauge hierarchy. Even in models for which kinetic mixing is suppressed or the D-terms are arranged to be small, this effect is a potentially large correction to the soft scalar masses and therefore introduces a new measurable low-energy parameter. We calculate the size of kinetic mixing both in field theory and in string theory, and argue that appreciable kinetic mixing is a generic feature of string models. We conclude that the possibility of kinetic mixing effects cannot be ignored in model-building and in phenomenological studies of the low-energy SUSY spectra.},

	abstract = {We examine spontaneous symmetry breaking of a renormalisable U(1) x U(1) gauge theory coupled to fermions when kinetic mixing is present. We do not assume that the kinetic mixing parameter is small. A rotation plus scaling is used to remove the mixing and put the gauge kinetic terms in the canonical form. Fermion currents are also rotated in a non-orthogonal way by this basis transformation. Through suitable redefinitions the interaction is cast into a diagonal form. This framework, where mixing is absent, is used for subsequent analysis. The symmetry breaking determines the fermionic current which couples to the massless gauge boson. The strength of this coupling as well as the couplings of the massive gauge boson are extracted. This formulation is used to consider a gauged model for dark matter by identifying the massless gauge boson with the photon and the massive state to its dark counterpart. Matching the coupling of the residual symmetry with that of the photon sets a lower bound on the kinetic mixing parameter. We present analytical formulae of the couplings of the dark photon in this model and indicate some physics consequences.},

We illustrate this with explicit examples of WIMPs connected to the Standard Model by metastable bosons or fermions. In all models, provided the WIMP mass is greater than that of the mediator, it can be secluded from the Standard Model with an extremely small elastic scattering cross-section on nuclei and rate for direct collider production. In contrast, indirect signatures from WIMP annihilation are consistent with a weak scale cross-section and provide potentially observable {\textbackslash}gamma-ray signals. We also point out that {\textbackslash}gamma-ray constraints and flavor physics impose severe restrictions on MeV-scale variants of secluded models, and identify limited classes that pass all the observational constraints.},

Because of the extreme simplicity of this setup, observational constraints lead to unambiguous determination of the model parameters. In particular, the DAMA scattering cross section is directly related to the size of the hypercharge D-term vacuum expectation value. The known relic abundance of DM can be used to fix the ratio of the dark sector coupling to the dark matter mass. Finally, the recent observation of cosmic ray positron and electron excesses can be used to fix the mass of the dark matter through the observation of a shoulder in the spectrum and the size of the kinetic mixing by fitting to the rate. These parameters can be used to make further predictions, which can be checked at future direct detection, indirect detection, as well as collider experiments.},

We study these mechanisms in detail in the context of gauge and gaugino mediation, and present specific models of Abelian GeV-scale hidden sectors. In particular, we discuss kinetic mixing of a U(1)\_x gauge force with hypercharge, singlets or bi-fundamentals which couple to both sectors, and additional loop effects.

	abstract = {Motivated by the recent proliferation of observed astrophysical anomalies, Arkani-Hamed et al. have proposed a model in which dark matter is charged under a non-abelian "dark" gauge symmetry that is broken at {\textasciitilde} 1 GeV. In this paper, we present a survey of concrete models realizing such a scenario, followed by a largely model-independent study of collider phenomenology relevant to the Tevatron and the LHC. We address some model building issues that are easily surmounted to accommodate the astrophysics. While SUSY is not necessary, we argue that it is theoretically well-motivated because the GeV scale is automatically generated. Specifically, we propose a novel mechanism by which mixed D-terms in the dark sector induce either SUSY breaking or a super-Higgs mechanism precisely at a GeV. Furthermore, we elaborate on the original proposal of Arkani-Hamed et al. in which the dark matter acts as a messenger of gauge mediation to the dark sector. In our collider analysis we present cross-sections for dominant production channels and lifetime estimates for primary decay modes. We find that dark gauge bosons can be produced at the Tevatron and the LHC, either through a process analogous to prompt photon production or through a rare Z decay channel. Dark gauge bosons will decay back to the SM via "lepton jets" which typically contain {\textgreater}2 and as many as 8 leptons, significantly improving their discovery potential. Since SUSY decays from the MSSM will eventually cascade down to these lepton jets, the discovery potential for direct electroweak-ino production may also be improved. Exploiting the unique kinematics, we find that it is possible to reconstruct the mass of the MSSM LSP. We also present decay channels with displaced vertices and multiple leptons with partially correlated impact parameters.},
