  abstract = {Experimenters report an upper limit if the signal they are trying to detect is nonexistent or below their experiment’s sensitivity. Such experiments may be contaminated with a background too poorly understood to subtract. If the background is distributed differently in some parameter from the expected signal, it is possible to take advantage of this difference to get a stronger limit than would be possible if the difference in distribution were ignored. We discuss the “maximum gap” method, which finds the best gap between events for setting an upper limit, and generalize to the “optimum interval” method, which uses intervals with especially few events. These methods, which apply to the case of relatively small backgrounds, do not use binning, are relatively insensitive to cuts on the range of the parameter, are parameter independent (i.e., do not change when a one-one change of variables is made), and provide true, though possibly conservative, classical one-sided confidence intervals.},

  abstract = {The SLAC RCE platform is a general purpose clustered data acquisition system implemented on a custom ATCA compliant blade, called the Cluster On Board (COB). The core of the system is the Reconfigurable Cluster Element (RCE), which is a system-on-chip design based upon the Xilinx Zynq family of FPGAs, mounted on custom COB daughter-boards. The Zynq architecture couples a dual core ARM Cortex A9 based processor with a high performance 28nm FPGA. The RCE has 12 external general purpose bi-directional high speed links, each supporting serial rates of up to 12Gbps. 8 RCE nodes are included on a COB, each with a 10Gbps connection to an on-board 24-port Ethernet switch integrated circuit. The COB is designed to be used with a standard full-mesh ATCA backplane allowing multiple RCE nodes to be tightly interconnected with minimal interconnect latency. Multiple shelves can be clustered using the front panel 10-gbps connections. The COB also supports local and inter-blade timing and trigger distribution. An experiment specific Rear Transition Module adapts the 96 high speed serial links to specific experiments and allows an experiment-specific timing and busy feedback connection. This coupling of processors with a high performance FPGA fabric in a low latency, multiple node cluster allows high speed data processing that can be easily adapted to any physics experiment. RTEMS and Linux are both ported to the module. The RCE has been used or is the baseline for several current and proposed experiments (LCLS, HPS, LSST, ATLAS-CSC, LBNE, DarkSide, ILC-SiD, etc)},

The chip is fabricated in a standard 0.25 μm CMOS process to take advantage of the radiation tolerance, lower noise and power, and high circuit density. Experimental characterisation of this circuit shows full functionality and good performance both in pre- and post-irradiation (20 Mrad) conditions. The measured noise is significantly reduced compared to earlier APV versions. A description of the design and results from measurements prior to irradiation are presented.},

  abstract = {The KEKB factory (Tsukuba, Japan) has been shut down in mid-2010 after reaching a total integrated luminosity of 1ab-1. Recently, the work on an upgrade of the collider (SuperKEKB), aiming at an ultimate luminosity of 8×1035 cm-2s-1, has started. This is 40 times the peak value of the previous system and thus also requires a redesign of the Belle detector (leading to Belle II), especially its Silicon Vertex Detector (SVD), which surrounds the beam pipe. Similar to its predecessor, the future Belle II SVD will again consist of four layers of double-sided silicon strip sensors (DSSD), but at higher radii. Moreover, a double-layer PiXel Detector (PXD) will complement the SVD as the innermost sensing device. All DSSDs will be made from 6” silicon wafers and read out by APV25 chips, which were originally developed for the CMS experiment. That system was proven to meet the requirements for Belle II in matters of occupancy and dead time. Since the KEKB factory operates at relatively low energy, material inside the active volume has to be minimized in order to reduce multiple scattering. This can be achieved by the Origami chip-on-sensor concept, including a very light-weight mechanical support structure made from carbon fiber reinforced Airex foam. Moreover, CO2 cooling for the front-end chips will ensure high efficiency at minimum material budget.},

  abstract = {We have developed a modular readout system for the 30,720 channel Forward GEM Tracker recently installed in the STAR Experiment at RHIC, BNL. The modular architecture is based on a passive compact PCI backplane running a custom protocol, not PCI, connecting 6 readout modules to a readout controller module. The readout modules provide all necessary functions, including isolated power supplies, to operate up to 24 APV25 chips per module with high-impedance ground isolation. The front-end boards contain a minimal set of components as they are located inside the STAR TPC inner field cage and are inaccessible except during long shutdown periods. The front-end boards connect to the readout modules with cables up to 24 m in length, carrying unbuffered analog readout signals from the APV25 as well as power, trigger, clock and control. The readout module digitizes the APV analog samples to 12 bits at 37.532 MHz, and zero suppresses and buffers the data. The readout controller distributes trigger and clock from the central trigger system, gathers the data over the backplane, and ships it to a linux PC via a 2.125 Gbps optical data link (Detector Data Link (DDL) from ALICE). The PC gathers data from multiple readout controllers and dispatches it to the STAR event builders. The readout modules, controllers, and backplanes are housed in a common crate together with the GEM HV bias power supplies.},

  abstract = {Motivated by anomalies in cosmic ray observations and by attempts to solve questions of the Standard Model of particle physics like the (g−2)μ discrepancy, U(1) extensions of the Standard Model have been proposed in recent years. Such U(1) extensions allow for the interaction of dark matter by exchange of a photonlike massive force carrier γ′ not included in the Standard Model. In order to search for γ′ bosons, various experimental programs have been started. One approach is the dedicated search at fixed-target experiments at modest energies as performed at microtron (MAMI) or at the Jefferson Lab. In these experiments the process e(A,Z)→e(A,Z)l+l− is investigated, and a search for a very narrow resonance in the invariant mass distribution of the l+l− pair is performed. In this work we analyze this process in terms of signal and background in order to describe existing data obtained by the A1 experiment at MAMI with the aim to give accurate predictions for exclusion limits in the γ′ parameter space. We present a detailed theoretical analysis of the cross sections entering in the description of such processes.},

  abstract = {The Heavy Photon Search (HPS) is a new experiment at Jefferson Lab that will search for heavy U(1) vector bosons (heavy photons, dark photons or A') in the mass range of 10 MeV/c\^2 to 1 GeV/c\^2 that couple weakly to ordinary matter. Heavy photons in this mass range are theoretically favorable and may also mediate dark matter interactions. The heavy photon couples to electric charge through kinetic mixing with the photon, in turn, inducing an effective gauge coupling of the A' to electric charge, which is suppressed relative to the electron charge by a factor of ε \textasciitilde 10\^-2 - 10\^-12. Since heavy photons couple to electrons, they can be produced through a process analogous to bremsstrahlung radiation, subsequently decaying to narrow e+e- resonances which can be observed above the dominant QED trident background. For suitably small couplings, dark photons travel detectable distances before decaying, providing a second signature.HPS will utilize this production mechanism to probe heavy photons with relative couplings of ε\^2 \textasciitilde 10\^-5 - 10\^-10 and search for the e+e- decay of the heavy photon via two signatures: invariant mass and displaced vertex. Using Jefferson Lab’s high luminosity electron beam incident on a thin tungsten target along with a compact, large acceptance forward spectrometer consisting of a silicon vertex tracker and lead tungstate electromagnetic calorimeter, HPS will access unexplored regions in the mass-coupling phase space. The HPS engineering run took place in spring of 2015 using a 1.056 GeV, 50 nA beam. This dissertation will present the results of a resonance search for a heavy photon in the mass range between 20 MeV/c\^2 to 60 MeV/c\^2 using a portion of the unblinded engineering run data which amounts to a luminosity of 74 nb\^-1 (.4671 mC of charge).},

In the current version events at the parton, hadron and detector level can be generated directly from a web interface, for arbitrary processes in the Standard Model and in several physics scenarios beyond it (HEFT, MSSM, 2HDM). The most important additions are: a new framework for implementing user-defined new physics models; a standalone running mode for creating and testing matrix elements; generation of events corresponding to different processes, such as signal(s) and backgrounds, in the same run; two platforms for data analysis, where events are accessible at the parton, hadron and detector level; and the generation of inclusive multi-jet samples by combining parton-level events with parton showers. To illustrate the new capabilities of the package some applications to hadron collider physics are presented: 1) Higgs search in pp $\backslash$to H $\backslash$to W\^+W\^-: signal and backgrounds. 2) Higgs CP properties: pp $\backslash$to H jj\$in the HEFT. 3) Spin of a new resonance from lepton angular distributions. 4) Single-top and Higgs associated production in a generic 2HDM. 5) Comparison of strong SUSY pair production at the SPS points. 6) Inclusive W+jets matched samples: comparison with the Tevatron data.},

  abstract = {In experiments that are aimed at detecting astrophysical sources such as neutrino telescopes, one usually performs a search over a continuous parameter space (e.g. the angular coordinates of the sky, and possibly time), looking for the most significant deviation from the background hypothesis. Such a procedure inherently involves a "look elsewhere effect", namely, the possibility for a signal-like fluctuation to appear anywhere within the search range. Correctly estimating the \$p\$-value of a given observation thus requires repeated simulations of the entire search, a procedure that may be prohibitively expansive in terms of CPU resources. Recent results from the theory of random fields provide powerful tools which may be used to alleviate this difficulty, in a wide range of applications. We review those results and discuss their implementation, with a detailed example applied for neutrino point source analysis in the IceCube experiment.},

This is the so called "look elsewhere effect". The effect can be quantified in terms of a trial factor, which is the ratio between the probability of observing the excess at some fixed mass point, to the probability of observing it anywhere in the range. We propose a simple and fast procedure for estimating the trial factor, based on earlier results by Davies. We show that asymptotically, the trial factor grows linearly with the (fixed mass) significance.},

This point is chosen to be close to the primary and short-lived secondary vertices, or to the decay vertex of a long-lived particle; hence useful approximations may be utilised. The extrapolation of the trajectory and its error matrix to the vertex region is performed once per track, even if the track association procedure needs to be iterated. The time spent on the computation of the fitting procedure is proportional to the number of tracks (n) instead of n3 as in a standard least-squares method where the parameters of all tracks are fitted together at their common vertex. The method is used in the LEP experiment DELPHI at CERN. The Monte Carlo test has been made for the ZEUS experiment at DESY. The vertex fitting quality and the time consumption etc. have been examined.},

This system allows end users to create complex detector geometries in a standard XML format rather than procedural code such as C++. The LCDD system is based on the Geometry Description Markup Language (GDML) from the LHC Applications Group (LCG). The geometry system facilitates the study of different full detector design and their variations. SLIC uses the StdHep format to read input created by event generators and outputs events in the Linear Collider IO (LCIO) format. The SLIC package provides a binding to GEANT4 and many additional commands and features for the end user.},

  abstract = {Dark sectors, consisting of new, light, weakly-coupled particles that do not interact with the known strong, weak, or electromagnetic forces, are a particularly compelling possibility for new physics. Nature may contain numerous dark sectors, each with their own beautiful structure, distinct particles, and forces. This review summarizes the physics motivation for dark sectors and the exciting opportunities for experimental exploration. It is the summary of the Intensity Frontier subgroup "New, Light, Weakly-coupled Particles" of the Community Summer Study 2013 (Snowmass). We discuss axions, which solve the strong CP problem and are an excellent dark matter candidate, and their generalization to axion-like particles. We also review dark photons and other dark-sector particles, including sub-GeV dark matter, which are theoretically natural, provide for dark matter candidates or new dark matter interactions, and could resolve outstanding puzzles in particle and astro-particle physics. In many cases, the exploration of dark sectors can proceed with existing facilities and comparatively modest experiments. A rich, diverse, and low-cost experimental program has been identified that has the potential for one or more game-changing discoveries. These physics opportunities should be vigorously pursued in the US and elsewhere.},

These experiments would also probe invisibly decaying new gauge bosons (“dark photons”) down to kinetic mixing of ε∼10−4, including the range of parameters relevant for explaining the (g−2)μ discrepancy. Sensitivity to other long-lived dark sector states and to new millicharge particles would also be improved.},

  abstract = {High-energy colliders offer a unique sensitivity to dark photons, the mediators of a broken dark U(1) gauge theory that kinetically mixes with the Standard Model (SM) hypercharge. Dark photons can be detected in the exotic decay of the 125 GeV Higgs boson, h -$>$ Z Z\_D -$>$ 4l, and in Drell-Yan events, pp -$>$ Z\_D -$>$ ll. If the dark U(1) is broken by a hidden-sector Higgs mechanism, then mixing between the dark and SM Higgs bosons also allows the exotic decay h -$>$ Z\_D Z\_D -$>$ 4l. We show that the 14 TeV LHC and a 100 TeV proton-proton collider provide powerful probes of both exotic Higgs decay channels. In the case of kinetic mixing alone, direct Drell-Yan production offers the best sensitivity to Z\_D, and can probe epsilon $>$\textasciitilde 9 x 10\^(-4) (4 x 10\^(-4)) at the HL-LHC (100 TeV pp collider). The exotic Higgs decay h -$>$ Z Z\_D offers slightly weaker sensitivity, but both measurements are necessary to distinguish the kinetically mixed dark photon from other scenarios. If Higgs mixing is also present, then the decay h -$>$ Z\_D Z\_D can allow sensitivity to the Z\_D for epsilon $>$\textasciitilde 10\^(-9) - 10\^(-6) (10\^(-10) - 10\^(-7)) for the mass range 2 m\_mu $<$ m\_(Z\_D) $<$ m\_h/2 by searching for displaced dark photon decays. We also compare the Z\_D sensitivity at pp colliders to the indirect, but model-independent, sensitivity of global fits to electroweak precision observables. We perform a global electroweak fit of the dark photon model, substantially updating previous work in the literature. Electroweak precision measurements at LEP, Tevatron, and the LHC exclude epsilon as low as 3 x 10\^(-2). Sensitivity can be improved by up to a factor of \textasciitilde{}2 with HL-LHC data, and an additional factor of \textasciitilde{}4 with ILC/GigaZ data.},

  abstract = {A new theory of WIMP Dark Matter has been proposed, motivated directly by striking Data from the PAMELA and ATIC collaborations. The WIMP is taken to be charged under a hidden gauge symmetry G\_Dark, broken near the GeV scale; this also provides the necessary ingredients for the "exciting" and "inelastic" Dark Matter interpretations of the INTEGRAL and DAMA signals. In this short note we point out the consequences of the most straightforward embedding of this simple picture within low-energy SUSY, in which G\_Dark breaking at the GeV scale arises naturally through radiative corrections, or Planck-suppressed operators. The theory predicts major additions to SUSY signals at the LHC. A completely generic prediction is that G\_Dark particles can be produced in cascade decays of MSSM superpartners, since these end with pairs of MSSM LSP's that in turn decay into the true LSP and other particles in the dark sector. In turn, the lightest GeV-scale dark Higgses and gauge bosons eventually decay back into light SM states, and dominantly into leptons. Therefore, a large fraction of all SUSY events will contain at least two ``lepton jets'': collections of n$>$= 2 leptons, with small angular separations and GeV scale invariant masses. Furthermore, if the Dark Matter sector is directly charged under the Standard Model, the success of gauge coupling unification implies the presence of new long-lived colored particles that can be copiously produced at the LHC.},

  abstract = {We propose a comprehensive theory of dark matter that explains the recent proliferation of unexpected observations in high-energy astrophysics. Cosmic ray spectra from ATIC and PAMELA require a WIMP with mass M\_chi \textasciitilde 500 - 800 GeV that annihilates into leptons at a level well above that expected from a thermal relic. Signals from WMAP and EGRET reinforce this interpretation. Taken together, we argue these facts imply the presence of a GeV-scale new force in the dark sector. The long range allows a Sommerfeld enhancement to boost the annihilation cross section as required, without altering the weak scale annihilation cross section during dark matter freezeout in the early universe. If the dark matter annihilates into the new force carrier, phi, its low mass can force it to decay dominantly into leptons. If the force carrier is a non-Abelian gauge boson, the dark matter is part of a multiplet of states, and splittings between these states are naturally generated with size alpha m\_phi \textasciitilde MeV, leading to the eXciting dark matter (XDM) scenario previously proposed to explain the positron annihilation in the galactic center observed by the INTEGRAL satellite. Somewhat smaller splittings would also be expected, providing a natural source for the parameters of the inelastic dark matter (iDM) explanation for the DAMA annual modulation signal. Since the Sommerfeld enhancement is most significant at low velocities, early dark matter halos at redshift \textasciitilde{}10 potentially produce observable effects on the ionization history of the universe, and substructure is more detectable than with a conventional WIMP. Moreover, the low velocity dispersion of dwarf galaxies and Milky Way subhalos can greatly increase the substructure annihilation signal.},

  abstract = {We consider a simple class of models in which the dark matter, X, is coupled to a new gauge boson, phi, with a relatively low mass (m\_phi $\backslash$sim 100 MeV-3 GeV). Neither the dark matter nor the new gauge boson have tree-level couplings to the Standard Model. The dark matter in this model annihilates to phi pairs, and for a coupling of g\_X $\backslash$sim 0.06 (m\_X/10 GeV)\^1/2 yields a thermal relic abundance consistent with the cosmological density of dark matter. The phi's produced in such annihilations decay through a small degree of kinetic mixing with the photon to combinations of Standard Model leptons and mesons. For dark matter with a mass of $\backslash$sim10 GeV, the shape of the resulting gamma-ray spectrum provides a good fit to that observed from the Galactic Center, and can also provide the very hard electron spectrum required to account for the observed synchrotron emission from the Milky Way's radio filaments. For kinetic mixing near the level naively expected from loop-suppressed operators (epsilon $\backslash$sim 10\^\{-4\}), the dark matter is predicted to scatter elastically with protons with a cross section consistent with that required to accommodate the signals reported by DAMA/LIBRA, CoGeNT and CRESST-II.},

A low-mass dark sector can explain the annual modulation signal reported by DAMA/LIBRA and the PAMELA, ATIC, and INTEGRAL observations by generating small mass splittings and new interactions for weak-scale dark matter. Some of these observations may be the first signs of a low-mass dark sector that collider searches can definitively confirm. Production and decay of ⬚⬚(GeV)-mass dark states is mediated by a Higgsed Abelian gauge boson that mixes kinetically with hypercharge. Existing data from BABAR, BELLE, CLEO-c, and KLOE may contain thousands of striking dark-sector events with a high multiplicity of leptons that reconstruct mass resonances and possibly displaced vertices. We discuss the production and decay phenomenology of Higgsed and confined dark sectors and propose e+e− collider search strategies. We also use the DAMA/LIBRA signal to estimate the production cross sections and decay lifetimes for dark-sector states.},

We illustrate this with explicit examples of WIMPs connected to the Standard Model by metastable bosons or fermions. In all models, provided the WIMP mass is greater than that of the mediator, it can be secluded from the Standard Model with an extremely small elastic scattering cross-section on nuclei and rate for direct collider production. In contrast, indirect signatures from WIMP annihilation are consistent with a weak scale cross-section and provide potentially observable $\backslash$gamma-ray signals. We also point out that $\backslash$gamma-ray constraints and flavor physics impose severe restrictions on MeV-scale variants of secluded models, and identify limited classes that pass all the observational constraints.},

  abstract = {The most general Lagrangian for a model with two U(1) gauge symmetries contains a renormalizable operator which mixes their gauge kinetic terms. Such kinetic mixing can be generated at arbitrarily high scales but will not be suppressed by large masses. In models whose supersymmetry (SUSY)-breaking hidden sectors contain U(1) gauge factors, we show that such terms will generically arise and communicate SUSY-breaking to the visible sector through mixing with hypercharge. In the context of the usual supergravity- or gauge-mediated communication scenarios with D-terms of order the fundamental scale of SUSY-breaking, this effect can destabilize the gauge hierarchy. Even in models for which kinetic mixing is suppressed or the D-terms are arranged to be small, this effect is a potentially large correction to the soft scalar masses and therefore introduces a new measurable low-energy parameter. We calculate the size of kinetic mixing both in field theory and in string theory, and argue that appreciable kinetic mixing is a generic feature of string models. We conclude that the possibility of kinetic mixing effects cannot be ignored in model-building and in phenomenological studies of the low-energy SUSY spectra.},

We do not assume that the kinetic mixing parameter is small. A rotation plus scaling is used to remove the mixing and put the gauge kinetic terms in the canonical form. Fermion currents are also rotated in a non-orthogonal way by this basis transformation. Through suitable redefinitions the interaction is cast into a diagonal form. This framework, where mixing is absent, is used for subsequent analysis. The symmetry breaking determines the fermionic current which couples to the massless gauge boson. The strength of this coupling as well as the couplings of the massive gauge boson are extracted. This formulation is used to consider a gauged model for dark matter by identifying the massless gauge boson with the photon and the massive state to its dark counterpart. Matching the coupling of the residual symmetry with that of the photon sets a lower bound on the kinetic mixing parameter. We present analytical formulae of the couplings of the dark photon in this model and indicate some physics consequences.},

In particular, the DAMA scattering cross section is directly related to the size of the hypercharge D-term vacuum expectation value. The known relic abundance of DM can be used to fix the ratio of the dark sector coupling to the dark matter mass. Finally, the recent observation of cosmic ray positron and electron excesses can be used to fix the mass of the dark matter through the observation of a shoulder in the spectrum and the size of the kinetic mixing by fitting to the rate.

  abstract = {Motivated by the recent proliferation of observed astrophysical anomalies, Arkani-Hamed et al. have proposed a model in which dark matter is charged under a non-abelian "dark" gauge symmetry that is broken at \textasciitilde 1 GeV. In this paper, we present a survey of concrete models realizing such a scenario, followed by a largely model-independent study of collider phenomenology relevant to the Tevatron and the LHC. We address some model building issues that are easily surmounted to accommodate the astrophysics. While SUSY is not necessary, we argue that it is theoretically well-motivated because the GeV scale is automatically generated. Specifically, we propose a novel mechanism by which mixed D-terms in the dark sector induce either SUSY breaking or a super-Higgs mechanism precisely at a GeV. Furthermore, we elaborate on the original proposal of Arkani-Hamed et al. in which the dark matter acts as a messenger of gauge mediation to the dark sector. In our collider analysis we present cross-sections for dominant production channels and lifetime estimates for primary decay modes. We find that dark gauge bosons can be produced at the Tevatron and the LHC, either through a process analogous to prompt photon production or through a rare Z decay channel. Dark gauge bosons will decay back to the SM via "lepton jets" which typically contain $>$2 and as many as 8 leptons, significantly improving their discovery potential. Since SUSY decays from the MSSM will eventually cascade down to these lepton jets, the discovery potential for direct electroweak-ino production may also be improved. Exploiting the unique kinematics, we find that it is possible to reconstruct the mass of the MSSM LSP. We also present decay channels with displaced vertices and multiple leptons with partially correlated impact parameters.},

  abstract = {We perform a detailed analysis of the phenomenological properties of hidden Abelian gauge bosons with a kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon within type IIB flux compactifications. We study the interplay between moduli stabilisation and the Green-Schwarz mechanism that gives mass to the hidden photon paying particular attention to the role of D-terms. We present two generic classes of explicit Calabi-Yau examples with an isotropic and an anisotropic shape of the extra dimensions showing how the last case turns out to be very promising to make contact with current experiments. In fact, anisotropic compactifications lead naturally to a GeV-scale hidden photon ("dark forces" that can be searched for in beam dump experiments) for an intermediate string scale; or even to an meV-scale hidden photon (which could lead to a "hidden CMB" and can be tested by light-shining-through-a-wall experiments) in the case of TeV-scale strings.},

They can kinetically mix with the Standard Model photon and are thereby accessible to a wide variety of astrophysical and cosmological observations and laboratory experiments. In this paper we investigate the masses and the kinetic mixing of hidden U(1)s in LARGE volume compactifications of string theory. We find that in these scenarios the hidden photons can be naturally light and that their kinetic mixing with the ordinary electromagnetic photon can be of a size interesting for near future experiments and observations.},

  abstract = {Positrons are known to be produced in interactions between cosmic-ray nuclei and interstellar matter ("secondary production"). Positrons may, however, also be created by dark matter particle annihilations in the galactic halo or in the magnetospheres of near-by pulsars. The nature of dark matter is one of the most prominent open questions in science today. An observation of positrons from pulsars would open a new observation window on these sources. Here we present results from the PAMELA satellite experiment on the positron abundance in the cosmic radiation for the energy range 1.5 - 100 GeV. Our high energy data deviate significantly from predictions of secondary production models, and may constitute the first indirect evidence of dark matter particle annihilations, or the first observation of positron production from near-by pulsars. We also present evidence that solar activity significantly affects the abundance of positrons at low energies.},

Because the instrument does not have an onboard magnet, we distinguish the two species by exploiting the Earth's shadow, which is offset in opposite directions for opposite charges due to the Earth's magnetic field. We estimate and subtract the cosmic-ray proton background using two different methods that produce consistent results. We report the electron-only spectrum, the positron-only spectrum, and the positron fraction between 20 GeV and 200 GeV. We confirm that the fraction rises with energy in the 20-100 GeV range. The three new spectral points between 100 and 200 GeV are consistent with a fraction that is continuing to rise with energy.},

The results were obtained with the PAMELA experiment, which was launched into low-earth orbit on-board the Resurs-DK1 satellite on June 15th 2006. During 500 days of data collection a total of about 1000 antiprotons have been identified, including 100 above an energy of 20 GeV. The high-energy results are a ten-fold improvement in statistics with respect to all previously published data. The data follow the trend expected from secondary production calculations and significantly constrain contributions from exotic sources, e.g. dark matter particle annihilations.},

  abstract = {Anomalies in direct and indirect detection have motivated models of dark matter consisting of a multiplet of nearly-degenerate states, coupled by a new GeV-scale interaction. We perform a careful analysis of the thermal freezeout of dark matter annihilation in such a scenario. We compute the range of "boost factors" arising from Sommerfeld enhancement in the local halo for models which produce the correct relic density, and show the effect of including constraints on the saturated enhancement from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that boost factors from Sommerfeld enhancement of up to \textasciitilde{}800 are possible in the local halo. When the CMB bounds on the saturated enhancement are applied, the maximal boost factor is reduced to \textasciitilde{}400 for 1-2 TeV dark matter and sub-GeV force carriers, but remains large enough to explain the observed Fermi and PAMELA electronic signals. We describe regions in the DM mass-boost factor plane where the cosmic ray data is well fit for a range of final states, and show that Sommerfeld enhancement alone is enough to provide the large annihilation cross sections required to fit the data, although for light mediator masses (less than \textasciitilde{}200 MeV) there is tension with the CMB constraints in the absence of astrophysical boost factors from substructure. Additionally, we consider the circumstances under which WIMPonium formation is relevant and find for heavy WIMPs (greater than \textasciitilde{}2 TeV) and soft-spectrum annihilation channels it can be an important consideration; we find regions with dark matter mass greater than 2.8 TeV that are consistent with the CMB bounds and have \textasciitilde{}600-700 present-day boost factors.},

In this letter, we consider possibility that this signal is the result of dark matter annihilations taking place in the halo of the Milky Way. Rather than focusing on a specific particle physics model, we take a phenomenological approach and consider a variety of masses and two-body annihilation modes, including W+W-, ZZ, b bbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, and e+e. We also consider a range of diffusion parameters consistent with current cosmic ray data. We find that a significant upturn in the positron fraction above 10 GeV is compatible with a wide range of dark matter annihilation modes, although very large annihilation cross sections and/or boost factors arising from inhomogeneities in the local dark matter distribution are required to produce the observed intensity of the signal. We comment on constraints from gamma rays, synchrotron emission, and cosmic ray antiproton measurements.},

  abstract = {In models of dark matter (DM) with Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation, where the annihilation rate scales as the inverse velocity, N-body simulations of DM structure formation suggest that the local annihilation signal may be dominated by small, dense, cold subhalos. This contrasts with the usual assumption of a signal originating from the smooth DM halo, with much higher velocity dispersion. Accounting for local substructure modifies the parameter space for which Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilating DM can explain the PAMELA and Fermi excesses. Limits from the inner galaxy and the cosmic microwave background are weakened, without introducing new tension with substructure-dependent limits, such as from dwarf galaxies or isotropic gamma-ray studies. With substructure, previously excluded parameter regions with mediators of mass \textasciitilde{}1-200 MeV are now easily allowed. For O(MeV) mediators, subhalos in a specific range of host halo masses may be evaporated, further suppressing diffuse signals without affecting substructure in the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {Updated constraints on dark matter cross section and mass are presented combining CMB power spectrum measurements from Planck, WMAP9, ACT, and SPT as well as several low-redshift datasets (BAO, HST, supernovae). For the CMB datasets, we combine WMAP9 temperature and polarization data for l $<$= 431 with Planck temperature data for 432 $<$ l $<$ 2500, ACT and SPT data for l $>$ 2500, and Planck CMB four-point lensing measurements. We allow for redshift-dependent energy deposition from dark matter annihilation by using a `universal' energy absorption curve. We also include an updated treatment of the excitation, heating, and ionization energy fractions, and provide updated deposition efficiency factors (f\_eff) for 41 different dark matter models. Assuming perfect energy deposition (f\_eff = 1) and a thermal cross section, dark matter masses below 26 GeV are excluded at the 2-sigma level. Assuming a more generic efficiency of f\_eff = 0.2, thermal dark matter masses below 5 GeV are disfavored at the 2-sigma level. These limits are a factor of \textasciitilde{}2 improvement over those from WMAP9 data alone. These current constraints probe, but do not exclude, dark matter as an explanation for reported anomalous indirect detection observations from AMS-02/PAMELA and the Fermi Gamma-ray Inner Galaxy data. They also probe relevant models that would explain anomalous direct detection events from CDMS, CRESST, CoGeNT, and DAMA, as originating from a generic thermal WIMP. Projected constraints from the full Planck release should improve the current limits by another factor of \textasciitilde{}2, but will not definitely probe these signals. The proposed CMB Stage IV experiment will more decisively explore the relevant regions and improve upon the Planck constraints by another factor of \textasciitilde{}2.},

With the new and much more precise measurement of the positron fraction recently provided by AMS, we revisit the question of the origin of these high energy positrons. We find that while some dark matter models (annihilating directly to electrons or muons) no longer appear to be capable of accommodating these data, other models in which \textasciitilde{}1-3 TeV dark matter particles annihilate to unstable intermediate states could still be responsible for the observed signal. Nearby pulsars also remain capable of explaining the observed positron fraction. Future measurements of the positron fraction by AMS (using a larger data set), combined with their anticipated measurements of various cosmic ray secondary-to-primary ratios, may enable us to further discriminate between these remaining scenarios.},

We find that the morphology and spectrum of the emission between 1.25 degrees and 10 degrees from the Galactic Center is well described by a the processes of decaying pions produced in cosmic ray collisions with gas, and the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic ray electrons in both the disk and bulge of the Inner Galaxy, along with gamma rays from known points sources in the region. The observed spectrum and morphology of the emission within approximately 1.25 degrees (\textasciitilde{}175 parsecs) of the Galactic Center, in contrast, departs from the expectations for by these processes. Instead, we find an additional component of gamma ray emission that is highly concentrated around the Galactic Center. The observed morphology of this component is consistent with that predicted from annihilating dark matter with a cusped (and possibly adiabatically contracted) halo distribution (density proportional to r\^\{-gamma\}, with gamma=1.18 to 1.33). The observed spectrum of this component, which peaks at energies between 1-4 GeV (in E\^2 units), can be well fit by a 7-10 GeV dark matter particle annihilating primarily to tau leptons with a cross section in the range of 4.6 x 10\^-27 to 5.3 x 10\^-26 cm\^3/s, depending on how the dark matter distribution is normalized. We also discuss other sources for this emission, including the possibility that much of it originates from the Milky Way's supermassive black hole.},

However, it is very weak and located within 50-110eV of several known faint lines, and so is subject to significant modeling uncertainties. On the origin of this line, we argue that there should be no atomic transitions in thermal plasma at this energy. An intriguing possibility is the decay of sterile neutrino, a long-sought dark matter particle candidate. Assuming that all dark matter is in sterile neutrinos with m\_s=2E=7.1 keV, our detection in the full sample corresponds to a neutrino decay mixing angle sin\^2(2theta)=7e-11, below the previous upper limits. However, based on the cluster masses and distances, the line in Perseus is much brighter than expected in this model. This appears to be because of an anomalously bright line at E=3.62 keV in Perseus, possibly an Ar XVII dielectronic recombination line, although its flux would be 30 times the expected value and physically difficult to understand. In principle, such an anomaly might explain our line detection in other subsamples as well, though it would stretch the line energy uncertainties. Another alternative is the above anomaly in the Ar line combined with the nearby 3.51 keV K line also exceeding expectation by factor 10-20. Confirmation with Chandra and Suzaku, and eventually Astro-H, are required to determine the nature of this new line.(ABRIDGED)},

  abstract = {We present N-body simulations of a new class of self-interacting dark matter models, which do not violate any astrophysical constraints due to a non-power-law velocity dependence of the transfer cross section which is motivated by a Yukawa-like new gauge boson interaction. Specifically, we focus on the formation of a Milky Way-like dark matter halo taken from the Aquarius project and re-simulate it for a couple of representative cases in the allowed parameter space of this new model. We find that for these cases, the main halo only develops a small core (\textasciitilde{}1 kpc) followed by a density profile identical to that of the standard cold dark matter scenario outside of that radius. Neither the subhalo mass function nor the radial number density of subhaloes are altered in these models but there is a significant change in the inner density structure of subhaloes resulting in the formation of a large density core. As a consequence, the inner circular velocity profiles of the most massive subhaloes differ significantly from the cold dark matter predictions and we demonstrate that they are compatible with the observational data of the brightest Milky Way dSphs in such a velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter scenario. Specifically, and contrary to the cold dark matter case, there are no subhaloes that are more concentrated than what is inferred from the kinematics of the Milky Way dSphs. We conclude that these models offer an interesting alternative to the cold dark matter model that can reduce the recently reported tension between the brightest Milky Way satellites and the dense subhaloes found in cold dark matter simulations.},

  abstract = {We show that dissipationless LCDM simulations predict that the majority of the most massive subhaloes of the Milky Way are too dense to host any of its bright satellites (L\_V $>$ 10\^5 L\_sun). These dark subhaloes have circular velocities at infall of 30-70 km/s and infall masses of [0.2-4] x 10\^10 M\_sun. Unless the Milky Way is a statistical anomaly, this implies that galaxy formation becomes effectively stochastic at these masses. This is in marked contrast to the well-established monotonic relation between galaxy luminosity and halo circular velocity (or halo mass) for more massive haloes. We show that at least two (and typically four) of these massive dark subhaloes are expected to produce a larger dark matter annihilation flux than Draco. It may be possible to circumvent these conclusions if baryonic feedback in dwarf satellites or different dark matter physics can reduce the central densities of massive subhaloes by order unity on a scale of 0.3 - 1 kpc.},

Excluding mass concentrations centered on visible galaxies, more than 98\% of the remaining mass is represented by a smooth concentration of dark matter centered near the brightest cluster galaxies, with a 35 h -1 kpc soft core. The asymmetry in the mass distribution is less than 3\% inside 107 h -1 kpc radius. The dark matter distribution we observe in CL 0024 is far more smooth, symmetric, and nonsingular than in typical simulated clusters in either Ω=1 or Ω=0.3 cold dark matter cosmologies.

We study the dynamics of self-interacting DM via a light mediator, focusing on the quantum resonant regime where the scattering cross section has a non-trivial velocity dependence. While there are long-standing indications that observations of small scale structure in the Universe are not in accord with the predictions of collisionless DM, theoretical study and simulations of DM self-interactions have focused on parameter regimes with simple analytic solutions for the scattering cross section, with constant or classical velocity (and no angular) dependence. We devise a method that allows us to explore the velocity and angular dependence of self-scattering more broadly, in the strongly-coupled resonant and classical regimes where many partial modes are necessary for the achieving the result. We map out the entire parameter space of DM self-interactions --- and implications for structure observations --- as a function of the coupling and the DM and mediator masses. We derive a new analytic formula for describing resonant s-wave scattering. Finally, we show that DM self-interactions can be correlated with observations of Sommerfeld enhancements in DM annihilation through indirect detection experiments.},

  abstract = {The cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model has been remarkably successful in explaining cosmic structure over an enormous span of redshift, but it has faced persistent challenges from observations that probe the innermost regions of dark matter halos and the properties of the Milky Way's dwarf galaxy satellites. We review the current observational and theoretical status of these "small scale controversies." Cosmological simulations that incorporate only gravity and collisionless CDM predict halos with abundant substructure and central densities that are too high to match constraints from galaxy dynamics. The solution could lie in baryonic physics: recent numerical simulations and analytic models suggest that gravitational potential fluctuations tied to efficient supernova feedback can flatten the central cusps of halos in massive galaxies, and a combination of feedback and low star-formation efficiency could explain why most of the dark matter subhalos orbiting the Milky Way do not host visible galaxies. However, it is not clear that this solution can work in the lowest mass galaxies where discrepancies are observed. Alternatively, the small-scale conflicts could be evidence of more complex physics in the dark sector itself. For example, elastic scattering from strong dark matter self-interactions can alter predicted halo mass profiles, leading to good agreement with observations across a wide range of galaxy mass. Gravitational lensing and dynamical perturbations of tidal streams in the stellar halo provide evidence for an abundant population of low mass subhalos in accord with CDM predictions. These observational approaches will get more powerful over the next few years.},

We compile observational properties of LSB galaxies to evaluate the plausibility that a previously higher baryonic mass content and feedback from star formation can modify the dark matter halos of these galaxies. We also compare the properties of bulgeless disk galaxies formed in recent simulations to the LSB galaxy sample. We find that observational constraints on LSB galaxy star formation histories, structure, and kinematics make it difficult for baryonic physics to sphericalize and decrease the central density of the dark matter halos of LSB galaxies.},
