I would like to thank everyone who made this dissertation, and the HPS experiment, possible.

First, thanks to John Jaros for being a great advisor, and letting me choose my direction while always asking the right questions.
I would also like to thank my other reading committee members, Pat Burchat and Michael Peskin, and my other orals committee members, Tony Heinz and Tom Shutt.
Thank you all for your help with this dissertation, and for making me a better physicist.

Thanks to the whole HPS collaboration for making this experiment work.
Thanks to Matt Graham and Takashi Maruyama for really understanding how the experiment and analysis should work, and passing that knowledge on to me.
Thanks to Tim Nelson for teaching me, by example, how to build a tracker, and Matt McCulloch for teaching me how to not break things.
Thanks to Stepan Stepanyan for getting us beam and making sure we had a detector ready for beam.
Finally, thanks to Pelle Hansson, Omar Moreno, and Matt Solt for putting in the hours with me in the trenches, both at SLAC and at JLab.

I would also like to thank my friends and family for their support throughout graduate school.
This dissertation is dedicated to my loving father.
