\chapter{Motivation}
There is current theoretical and experimental interest in a massive $U(1)$ vector boson that does not couple directly to particles in the Standard Model, but gains a weak effective coupling to charged particles through kinetic mixing.
This particle is commonly called a heavy photon, dark photon, or $A'$, and is characterized by its mass $m_{A'}$ and a dimensionless coupling constant $\epsilon$.

The heavy photon is primarily motivated as part of a larger ``dark sector'' of particles that are not charged directly under the Standard Model forces.
Some sort of ``portal'' is necessary to create an interaction between the dark sector and the Standard Model.
The possible portals are restricted by the symmetries of the Standard Model, and the dominant candidates are commonly referred to as the vector, Higgs, neutrino, and axion portals; the heavy photon is the mediator for the vector portal \cite{essig_dark_2013}.
Dark sector particles are natural candidates for dark matter, and a heavy photon can be part of a mechanism that produces the observed dark matter abundance.

%Massive U(1) vector bosons, also known as heavy photons, are a natural consequence of many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model.
%Such a particle could kinetically mix with the photon, giving it an effective coupling to electric charge much smaller than the photon's direct coupling $\alpha$.
%A heavy photon is one of several ``portals'' by which a dark sector could interact with Standard Model matter.
%
%The existence of such a heavy photon is a possible explanation for the cosmic ray positron excess and the muon $g-2$ anomaly.

\section{Theory Summary}
The basic assumption behind the heavy photon is that there exists a second (broken) $U(1)$ symmetry, and that it interacts with Standard Model hypercharge via kinetic mixing \cite{holdom_two_1986}.
At low energies, this leads to the following gauge field Lagrangian, where $F_{\mu\nu}=\partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$ is the electromagnetic field strength, $F'_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A'_\nu - \partial_\nu A'_\mu$ is the heavy photon field strength, and $\epsilon$ is the dimensionless coupling constant:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{gauge}}=-\frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{4}F'^{\mu\nu}F'_{\mu\nu} + \frac{1}{2}\epsilon F^{\mu\nu}F'_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}

The kinetic mixing means that the fields are not orthogonal.
Orthogonality can be restored by redefining the electromagnetic field according to $A^\mu \to A^\mu + \epsilon A'^\mu$.
This modifies the interaction Lagrangian as follows:

\begin{equation}
    A^\mu J^{EM}_\mu \to A^\mu J^{EM}_\mu + \epsilon A'^\mu J^{EM}_\mu 
\end{equation}

This implies that particles with electric charge acquire a coupling, proportional to $\epsilon$, to the heavy photon.
The converse is not true: hidden-sector particles with heavy photon couplings do not acquire couplings to the photon (such ``millicharged'' particles do occur if the new $U(1)$ is unbroken \cite{prinz_search_1998,davidson_updated_2000}) \cite{holdom_two_1986}.

If particles exist that are charged under both fields, kinetic mixing may arise from a one-loop diagram similar to Figure \ref{fig:oneloop}, with a natural scale of $\epsilon \sim 10^{-2}-10^{-4}$; on the other hand, GUT models require that one-loop contributions to $\epsilon$ vanish, and instead motivate two-loop contributions at $\epsilon \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-6}$ \cite{arkani-hamed_lhc_2008}.
Because kinetic mixing is a renormalizable interaction, $\epsilon$ is independent of the masses of the particles that give rise to it.
String theory models can motivate much smaller $\epsilon$, as low as $10^{-12}$ \cite{goodsell_naturally_2009,cicoli_testing_2011}.

There is a wide range of reasonable values for the mass $m_{A'}$.
Models where supersymmetry breaking is communicated by the kinetic mixing lead to natural mass scales of MeV-GeV \cite{baumgart_non-abelian_2009, morrissey_abelian_2009, cheung_kinetic_2009}.
String theory models typically tie the mass scale to $\epsilon$, and can motivate masses down to the meV scale \cite{goodsell_naturally_2009,cicoli_testing_2011}.

\section{Observations Motivating a Heavy Photon}

\subsection{Dark Matter Annihilation}

Dark matter annihilation mediated by a heavy photon has been proposed as an explanation for several anomalies that have been reported in cosmic ray and X-ray observations.

The PAMELA satellite first observed that the positron fraction $\phi(e^+)/(\phi(e^+)+\phi(e^-))$ increases above 10 GeV.
This is inconsistent with the assumption that high-energy positrons originate in secondary production processes, from cosmic-ray nuclei interactions with interstellar gas.
Meanwhile, the antiproton fraction is consistent with secondary production.
Measurements by the Fermi Large Area Telescope and the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) confirmed the observation and extended it to higher energies \cite{the_fermi_lat_collaboration_measurement_2012,ams_collaboration_first_2013}.

The annihilation cross-section implied by the positron flux is large compared to the cross-section expected for a thermal relic, and also much larger than any observed annihilation to hadrons \cite{cholis_high_2009}.
This is consistent with annihilation to heavy photons with then decay to electrons and positrons, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:dm_annihilation} \cite{arkani-hamed_theory_2009}.
A heavy photon with $m_{A'}<2m_p$ cannot decay to $p\bar{p}$, and $m_{A'}$ in the MeV--GeV range (models with $m_{A'}$ in the 200--900 MeV range were tested in \cite{finkbeiner_consistent_2011}; if annihilation is dominated by local subhalos, lower mass ranges are allowed \cite{slatyer_sommerfeld-enhanced_2012}) creates Sommerfeld enhancement that boosts the annihilation cross-section at low velocities.

\end{figure}

The positron fraction has more recently been disfavored as a motivation for the heavy photon.
A larger AMS data set shows the full shape of the positron spectrum is softer than would be expected from a heavy photon decaying directly to $e^+e^-$ \cite{ams_collaboration_high_2014}, but consistent with a pulsar origin for cosmic ray positrons \cite{cholis_dark_2013}.
Meanwhile, CMB observations put limits on the DM annihilation rate at recombination; measurements by Planck constrain the DM annihilation explanation for the positron fraction \cite{madhavacheril_current_2014}.
The positron spectrum may still be consistent with heavy photons decaying to intermediate states that then decay to $e^+e^-$ \cite{cholis_dark_2013}.

Gamma ray and X-ray excesses also motivate models of dark matter that include heavy photons.
Dark matter annihilation has been proposed as a source for an excess of high-energy gamma rays from the Galactic Center in Fermi data \cite{hooper_dark_2011}.
A 3.5 keV line seen in galaxy cluster X-ray spectra \cite{bulbul_detection_2014,boyarsky_unidentified_2014} has been suggested to come from collisional excitation and de-excitation of dark matter, in a model named eXciting Dark Matter (XDM) \cite{finkbeiner_x-ray_2014}.

\subsection{Halo Structure}
Observations of dark matter halos of galaxies and dwarf galaxies disagree with predictions based on the assumption of collisionless cold dark matter \cite{weinberg_cold_2013}.
These discrepancies have motivated models (``self-interacting dark matter,'' or SIDM) in which dark matter is self-interacting with a large but velocity-dependent cross-section, consistent with a heavy photon mediator.
This allows momentum diffusion in halos without disrupting high-velocity events such as the Bullet Cluster \cite{spergel_observational_2000,tulin_beyond_2013}.

Rotational velocities of observed Milky Way dwarf satellite galaxies are lower than the rotational velocities that simulations predict for the Milky Way's largest dark matter subhaloes.
This suggests that either the most massive dark matter subhalos fail to form dwarf galaxies, the massive subhalos do not exist, or the rotational velocities for a given subhalo mass are lower than predicted; this is known as the ``too big to fail'' problem \cite{boylan-kolchin_too_2011}.
Self-interacting dark matter reduces the central densities of subhalos and thus the rotational velocities \cite{vogelsberger_subhaloes_2012}.
Similarly, the observed density profiles of galaxies are better fit with a constant density core than the cuspy models from collisionless dark matter: this is the ``cusp-core'' problem \cite{de_naray_baryons_2011}
Both the observational evidence and the simulations continue to develop, and it may be possible to resolve the conflicts without abandoning collisionless dark matter \cite{oman_unexpected_2015,governato_cuspy_2012}.
